This directory is the parent directory of all default directories for files generated with the purpose of triggering some action outside Freezeman.

This folder holds :
- the run info file folder (RUN_INFO_OUTPUT_PATH),
- the validation info file folder (VALIDATED_FILES_OUTPUT_PATH),
- the release info file folder (RELEASED_FILES_OUTPUT_PATH).

By defining the matching environment variables, these folders can be moved outside the freezeman project structure.
