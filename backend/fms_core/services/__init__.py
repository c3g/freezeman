    Services functions should return a tuple (object/list_of_objects, list_of_errors) 
    These functions should be callable by any part of the app (viewsets, importers, etc.), 
    be single-responsability as much as possible, and should not have unintended side-effects
    (other than the creation, getting, updating, deleting) records.
